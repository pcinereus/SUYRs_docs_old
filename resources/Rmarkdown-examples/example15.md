# Section 1

The formula, $y=mx+c$, is displayed inline. 
Some symbols and equations (such as 
$\sum{x}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$) are rescaled 
to prevent disruptions to the regular 
line spacing.
For more voluminous equations (such as 
$\sum{\frac{(\mu - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$), 
some line spacing disruptions are unavoidable.  
Math should then be displayed in displayed mode.
$$\sum{\frac{(\mu - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$
